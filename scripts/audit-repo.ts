// Leak audit for the REPOSITORY, not the archive: `bun run audit` (part of `verify`).
//
// WHY A SECOND AUDIT. `package.ts` inspects the staged zip and refuses to write one
// that fails. That is the right check for the archive, and the archive deliberately
// excludes `*.test.ts` and `fixtures/` — so it never reads them. The repository is
// public and carries both. Nothing checked that, and the gap has been paid for twice:
// a real customer name survived in a test file after being removed from the module
// next to it, and four run-specific strings reached fixtures and header comments.
// Both times the archive audit passed, and passing was read as "clean".
//
// WHAT IT SCANS. Exactly the public surface — `git ls-files` plus untracked files git
// would not ignore. Not the working tree by walk: that would sweep in `data/`,
// `__backup/` and `dist/`, which are gitignored precisely because they never ship,
// and their hits would train the reader to skim past the report.
//
// WHAT IT CANNOT DO. Two limits, both stated in the output rather than left implied:
//
//   1. **The customer list is machine-local.** It is read from the work-tree roots at
//      runtime, never from a literal in this repo — an inventory of customer names
//      cannot live in a public repository. On a machine without those roots the audit
//      still runs the static patterns but is blind to names, and says so. The count is
//      printed; the names never are, because this output ends up in terminals, CI logs
//      and pasted snippets.
//   2. **History is out of scope by default.** Force-pushing does not purge GitHub's
//      unreachable objects (measured: an old commit stayed readable by SHA after
//      `filter-repo` + force push, and only deleting and recreating the repository
//      returned 404). So a hit in history is a different, heavier problem than a hit in
//      the working tree, and mixing them would blur the remedy. `--history` scans every
//      blob in the object database when you actually want that answer.
//
// Exit 0 clean, 1 on any hit. Non-skippable inside `verify` for the same reason the
// archive audit is not skippable in `package.ts`.

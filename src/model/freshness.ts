// The one non-obvious judgement is runtime-graph.json. It is not merely "old" —
// it is recompiled only when a transition-class event lands in the audit tail
// (GATE_APPROVED / STAGE_STARTED / STAGE_AWAITING_APPROVAL / AUDIT_MERGED /
// WORKFLOW_COMPLETED, per hooks/aidlc-runtime-compile.ts). Mid-stage the audit
// keeps growing while the graph does not, so during the phase of a run someone
// actually wants to watch, the graph is systematically behind.
//
// Measured on a real in-flight run: graph 19.2h behind the audit, its
// `sensor_firings` empty for the in-flight stage while the audit held 178
// firings, and 6 stages under-reported overall (a backward jump re-ran stages the
// graph had already snapshotted). Hence the comparison below is against the
// audit's last timestamp, not the wall clock: a paused run whose graph matches
// its audit is NOT stale, it is simply idle.

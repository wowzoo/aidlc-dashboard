// Directory listing for the folder picker.
//
// WHY A SERVER-SIDE BROWSER AND NOT THE BROWSER'S OWN PICKER. A file input with
// `webkitdirectory` hands back a FileList of the folder's CONTENTS, never the
// folder's absolute path — browsers withhold it deliberately. The server needs a
// path it can read, so the picker has to be a server-rendered listing. The
// showDirectoryPicker() File System Access API has the same problem: it yields a
// handle scoped to the browser sandbox, not a path.
//
// SAFETY. The dashboard binds to loopback only, so this listing is reachable
// only from this machine — it exposes no more than a local shell already can.
// That bind is NOT a default to be relied on: `Bun.serve` defaults to `0.0.0.0`
// (all interfaces), and the only thing narrowing it is the explicit
// `hostname: HOST` in `server.ts`. Dropping that line exposes this listing to the
// network, so it stays. Even so, the listing is deliberately narrow: names,
// types and an "is this an AI-DLC workspace" flag, never file contents. Symlinks
// are not followed into (a link to / would make the walk unbounded), and dotfiles
// are hidden unless the caller asks, so the common case is a short list.
